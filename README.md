# Data Structures & Algorithms Practice

This repository documents my journey learning data structures and algorithms through hands-on implementation and problem-solving. I practice DSA in my free time to strengthen both my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of how fundamental data structures work under the hood. I primarily work with Java but occasionally explore implementations in other languages like Python and JavaScript.

## Repository Structure

### Implementations
Building data structures from scratch to understand their internals, trade-offs, and optimal use cases.

### Problems
Solving algorithmic challenges that apply these data structures in real-world scenarios, with detailed explanations of my thought process.
